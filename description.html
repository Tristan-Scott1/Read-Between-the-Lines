            <p>For this project, I began by trying to figure out what kind of compositions I wanted to create.</p>
            <p>Immediately, I was drawn to typography posters for inspiration.</p> 
            <p>For my animations, I initially flirted with ideas like a printing press or screen printing, where new layers of color are added in a swiping motion, or even a factory line where new pieces were added with machine arms or other automation.</p>
            <p>However, when visually researching ideas for what posters I wanted to take inspiration from, I came across some Swiss designs that I enjoyed. I became interested in tackling the challenge of how I could create some unity between some unique and visually interesting posters, to make a piece that felt whole but still had three distinct compositions that each experimented with animation in unique and interesting ways.</p>
            <p>The one poster I was inspired by made me think of the line "read between the lines," and I wanted to roll with that. I ended up taking some more inspiration from a poem by Brian Bilston and used that as the unifying framework of the compositions.</p> 
            <p>Overall, I had a great time experimenting with variable typography and CSS animation in creative and expressive ways. I appreciate poster design, and it was fun to explore that in web format.</p>
            <p>Thank you for checking out my project!</p>
